## Architecture Overview

RustMQ is a cloud-native distributed message queue system with a **storage-compute separation architecture**. The system is designed around several key architectural principles with comprehensive operational capabilities for production deployment.

### Core Architecture Pattern

**Stateless Brokers + Shared Storage**: Unlike traditional message queues, RustMQ brokers are completely stateless. All persistent data lives in object storage (S3/GCS/Azure), while brokers maintain only ephemeral WAL files and caches for performance.

### Key Components and Their Interactions

1. **Storage Layer** (`src/storage/`):
   - **TieredStorageEngine**: Orchestrates the two-tier storage architecture
   - **DirectIOWal**: Enhanced local NVMe WAL with intelligent upload triggers and configurable flush behavior
     - Size-based upload triggers (default: 128MB segments)
     - Time-based upload triggers (default: 10 minutes)
     - Runtime configuration updates
     - Background flush tasks when fsync is disabled
     - Thread-safe segment tracking with race condition protection using atomic coordination
   - **ObjectStorage**: Abstracts cloud storage backends (S3/GCS/Azure/Local)
   - **CacheManager**: Manages separate write (hot) and read (cold) caches for workload isolation
   - **BufferPool**: Aligned buffer management for zero-copy operations

2. **Replication System** (`src/replication/`):
   - **ReplicationManager**: Implements leader-follower replication with configurable acknowledgment levels
     - **Optimized High-Watermark Calculation**: Hybrid algorithm using bounded max-heap for O(N log K) complexity instead of O(N log N)
       - K=1: Direct minimum search - O(N) time, O(1) space
       - K=2: Specialized linear scan - O(N) time, O(1) space  
       - K≥3: Bounded max-heap - O(N log K) time, O(K) space
       - Performance improvement: Up to 2x faster for large clusters (10,000+ brokers)
       - Memory improvement: Up to 99.997% reduction in memory usage (800KB → 24 bytes)
   - **FollowerReplicationHandler**: Enhanced follower logic with:
     - Real-time lag calculation based on leader high watermark vs follower WAL offset
     - Actual WAL offset tracking using `get_end_offset()` instead of hardcoded values
     - Leader epoch validation and automatic leadership updates
     - Proper error handling for WAL operations with specific error codes
   - Uses shared storage to eliminate traditional data movement during failover
   - Heartbeat monitoring and automatic failover without data loss

3. **Network Layer** (`src/network/`):
   - **QuicServer**: QUIC/HTTP3 protocol for client communication (eliminates head-of-line blocking)
   - **GrpcNetworkHandler**: Production-ready gRPC broker-to-broker communication with enterprise patterns:
     - Connection pooling with persistent gRPC channels and lazy initialization
     - Circuit breaker pattern with configurable thresholds (3 failures → half-open, 5 failures → open)
     - Parallel broadcasting with partial failure tolerance (succeeds if 50% of brokers reached)
     - Exponential backoff with jitter for intelligent retry logic
     - Real-time health tracking and connection statistics
     - Dynamic broker registration/deregistration for service discovery
   - Zero-copy data movement throughout the network stack

4. **Control Plane** (`src/controller/`):
   - Raft-based consensus for cluster coordination
   - Manages partition leadership assignment and load balancing
   - Metadata consistency across the cluster

5. **Scaling Operations** (`src/scaling/`):

   - **VolumeRecoveryManager**: Persistent volume recovery for broker failures
   - **RuntimeConfigManager**: Hot configuration updates without restarts

7. **Admin REST API** (`src/admin/`):
   - **AdminApi**: Comprehensive cluster management REST API server with advanced rate limiting
   - **RateLimiterManager**: Production-ready rate limiting using Token Bucket algorithm with `governor` crate
     - **Multi-level Rate Limiting**: Global, per-IP, and endpoint-specific limits with hierarchical precedence
     - **Endpoint Categorization**: Health (100 RPS), Read (30 RPS), Write (10 RPS), Cluster (5 RPS) operations
     - **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent access with DashMap and automatic cleanup of expired limiters
     - **HTTP 429 Responses**: Standard rate limiting headers (X-RateLimit-*, Retry-After) and JSON error format
     - **Configuration Integration**: Full TOML support with comprehensive validation and runtime configuration
   - **BrokerHealthTracker**: Real-time broker health monitoring with background checks
   - **Health Endpoints**: Service uptime tracking and cluster status assessment

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Client → QUIC → Broker → Local WAL → Cache → Object Storage
                   ↓
                Replication → Other Brokers
```

**Write Path**: 
1. Record arrives via QUIC
2. Written to local WAL (sync or async based on durability requirements)
3. Cached in write cache
4. Replicated to followers
5. Intelligent upload to object storage based on:
   - Segment size threshold (configurable, default 128MB)
   - Time interval threshold (configurable, default 10 minutes)
6. WAL space reclaimed after successful upload

**Read Path**:
1. Check write cache (for tailing consumers)
2. Check read cache (for historical consumers)  
3. Fetch from object storage if cache miss
4. Populate read cache

**Operational Flows**:
- **Scaling Operations**: Automated broker addition/removal with partition rebalancing
- **Rolling Upgrades**: Zero-downtime version upgrades with health verification
- **Volume Recovery**: Automatic persistent volume reattachment in Kubernetes environments

### Critical Design Decisions

- **Shared Storage**: Enables instant broker scaling and eliminates expensive data rebalancing
- **Workload Isolation**: Separate caches for hot (tailing) vs cold (historical) reads prevent interference
- **QUIC Protocol**: Reduces connection overhead and eliminates head-of-line blocking vs TCP
- **WebAssembly ETL**: Secure, sandboxed real-time data processing
- **Object Storage Optimization**: Intelligent compaction and bandwidth limiting for cost efficiency
- **Intelligent Upload Triggers**: Dual conditions (size + time) ensure optimal object storage utilization
- **Runtime Configuration**: Hot updates without service interruption for operational flexibility
